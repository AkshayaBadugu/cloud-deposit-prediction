# Deposit Prediction using Cloud-Ready ML Model

This machine learning project predicts whether a customer will make a deposit in a bank marketing campaign based on input features like age, job, balance, education, and more. The best-performing model is saved and ready for cloud deployment (no UI).

---

## Problem Statement

Banks run marketing campaigns to encourage customers to make term deposits. The goal is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a customer will subscribe to the deposit based on their attributes.
